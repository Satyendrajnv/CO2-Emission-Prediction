# CO₂ Emission Prediction Using Linear Regression 

This machine learning project predicts the CO₂ emissions of a car based on its engine volume and weight using multiple linear regression.

## 📊 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- StandardScaler for feature scaling
- LinearRegression from Scikit-learn

## 📁 Dataset
A custom CSV file with fields:
- Volume (liters)
- Weight (kg)
- CO2 (g/km)

## 📈 Results
- R² Score: 0.33
- Prediction Example: 1.3L engine + 2300kg car → ~107g CO₂

## Model Insights
- Feature scaling improves model accuracy.
- Volume and weight both positively affect emissions.

##  Try it yourself!
Clone the repo and run `co2_emission_model.py` or open the notebook.
